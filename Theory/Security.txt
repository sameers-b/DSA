Rate Limiting: Controls the number of requests a client can make in a given time to prevent system overload 
               and brute-force attacks. This can be set per endpoint, user, IP address, or overall.

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing): Specifies which domains are allowed to call your API from a browser, 
               preventing malicious websites from making requests on behalf of users.

SQL & NoSQL Injections: Discusses how attackers can manipulate user input to execute malicious database queries. 
               The solution involves using parameterized queries or ORM safeguards.

Firewalls: Act as gatekeepers, filtering malicious traffic (e.g., suspicious SQL keywords or HTTP methods) 
               from legitimate requests before they reach the API.

VPNs (Virtual Private Networks): Restrict API access to specific networks, useful for internal tools and preventing 
               external users from reaching private APIs.

CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery): Explains how attackers trick logged-in users into making unwanted requests. 
               Prevention involves using CSRF tokens in combination with session cookies.
               
XSS (Cross-Site Scripting): Describes how attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, 
               often through comment sections. These scripts can steal cookies or inject data into databases.
