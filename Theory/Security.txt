Rate Limiting: Controls the number of requests a client can make in a given time to prevent system overload 
               and brute-force attacks. This can be set per endpoint, user, IP address, or overall.

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing): Specifies which domains are allowed to call your API from a browser, 
               preventing malicious websites from making requests on behalf of users.

SQL & NoSQL Injections: Discusses how attackers can manipulate user input to execute malicious database queries. 
               The solution involves using parameterized queries or ORM safeguards.

Firewalls: Act as gatekeepers, filtering malicious traffic (e.g., suspicious SQL keywords or HTTP methods) 
               from legitimate requests before they reach the API.

VPNs (Virtual Private Networks): Restrict API access to specific networks, useful for internal tools and preventing 
               external users from reaching private APIs.

CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery): Explains how attackers trick logged-in users into making unwanted requests. 
               Prevention involves using CSRF tokens in combination with session cookies.

XSS (Cross-Site Scripting): Describes how attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, 
               often through comment sections. These scripts can steal cookies or inject data into databases.

API Design Fundamentals: 
    This section introduces what APIs are, their role in system architecture, and the three most common API 
    styles: REST, GraphQL, and gRPC. It emphasizes four essential design principles for great APIs: consistency, 
    simplicity, security, and performance. The process of API design, from requirement understanding to deployment 
    and maintenance, is also discussed.

API Protocols: 
    The video explains the role of API protocols in the network stack and details common application layer 
    protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, WebSockets, AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol), and gRPC. It highlights how each 
    protocol affects API structure, performance, and capabilities, advising on choosing the right protocol based on 
    specific API requirements.

Transport Layer: TCP & UDP: 
    This part delves into the transport layer protocols, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and 
    UDP (User Datagram Protocol). It contrasts TCP as reliable but slower, suitable for data integrity 
    (e.g., payments, authentication), with UDP as faster and less reliable, ideal for real-time communication where some data 
    loss is acceptable (e.g., video streaming, gaming).

RESTful API Design: 
    The video focuses on designing clean REST APIs. Key aspects include resource modeling (using nouns for URLs), 
    URL design, and incorporating filtering, sorting, and pagination for efficient data retrieval. 
    It also covers the standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) for CRUD operations and the appropriate 
    use of HTTP status codes for responses and error handling.

GraphQL API Design: 
    This section introduces GraphQL as an API style that allows clients to request exactly what they need with a 
    single endpoint, reducing round trips for complex UIs. It contrasts GraphQL's query and mutation operations 
    with REST's methods and discusses its schema evolution without explicit versioning.

Authentication: 
    This segment defines authentication as verifying a user's identity and explores various authentication methods, 
    including API keys, Basic Auth, Bearer tokens (like JWTs), OAuth, and OpenID Connect.

Authorization: 
    Authorization is explained as determining what an authenticated user is allowed to do. 
    It covers different authorization models such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-Based Access 
    Control (ABAC), and Access Control Lists (ACLs).

Security: 
    The video emphasizes security best practices for APIs, including input validation, rate limiting, 
    and protection against common threats like SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, and DDoS attacks.
