✅ Interface
------
   Defines object structure
   Can extend
   Supports declaration merging
   Best for object models

✅ Type
-------
   Creates custom type
   Can define unions, intersections, primitives
   More flexible than interface
   No declaration merging

✅ Difference
-------
   Interface → Mainly for objects
   Type → For unions & complex types
   Interface can merge, type cannot

✅ Generics
--------
   Makes code reusable & type-safe
   Type is decided later
   Used in APIs, reusable components

✅ Union
--------
   Allows multiple possible types

   Used for states like loading | success | error
